The commercial Haskell group is a special interest group for companies and individuals interested in commercial usage of Haskell. It is composed primarily of three different things:

* A [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/commercialhaskell) for discussions
* A [wiki](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/commercialhaskell/wiki) to write down more concrete ideas after discussing them on the mailing list
* A [Github organization](https://github.com/commercialhaskell) for sharing and collaborating on code

The primary purpose here is to foster discussion and encourage collaboration. This group is currently just starting, and many aspects of its purpose and workflows are yet to be decided. We strongly encourage everyone interested to get involved now and be part of making this group a success. Some concrete goals for this group include:

* Improve the quality of open source Haskell tooling and libraries to meet commercial requirements.
* Broaden the library coverage provided by the open source Haskell world.
* Increase documentation in the Haskell ecosystem, including both API docs (Haddocks) and tutorials/cookbooks.
* Identify obstacles to Haskell adoption and devise strategies and roadmaps to overcome them.
* Share information on requirements so that open-source contributors can focus their contributions in areas of greatest need or opportunity
* Publicize Haskell successes (and available tools/solutions) both inside and outside the Haskell community

## FAQ

  * Question: How is this different from the Industrial Haskell User Group (IHG)?
  * Answer: To join the IHG you pay and that's joining into a pool of work which gets done. This model is good because it guarantees that things will get accomplished, but it also has its limitations. Commercial Haskell is free and has no paid for pool of work. Companies must figure out how they want to collaborate to accomplish common interests. The two groups are largely complementary, and companies are encouraged to join both.


## Membership

The following is a list of members of the group. Everyone is welcome to be part of the mailing list and participate in the Wiki. If you'd like to join more officially, please send a pull request adding yourself or your company in the list below. There are no requirements - financial or otherwise - on members of the group. But you should be using Haskell in a commercial/industrial setting, interested in doing so, or interested in helping those who are.

(Please try to keep the lists in alphabetical order.)
